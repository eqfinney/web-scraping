## Asynchronous Web Scraping
Author: Emily Quinn Finney
Version: 2.0

In this package I implemented an asynchronous breadth first search based web
crawler/scraper as part of my time at the Recurse Center 
(https://www.recurse.com/). The package relies primarily on Python's asyncio
and Beautiful Soup libraries. While writing this code, I tested two different 
methods of object-oriented software design (dependency injection and stitching 
together unrelated classes into a main class). 

Version 1.0 was written recursively, and was not implemented asynchronously.
